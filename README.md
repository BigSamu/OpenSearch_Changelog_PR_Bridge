## Installation

In order for the app to work as intended, it must be installed both on an OpenSearch repository as well as on any forked repositories that PRs originate from.

<!-- omit from toc -->
### Installing on an OpenSearch Repository

- Navigate to the [OpenSearch-bot](https://github.com/apps/opensearch-bot) installation page and click "Install".
- Select the OpenSearch repository where this app will manage PRs and process changeset files.
- Follow the instructions to complete the installation.

### Installing on Forked Repositories

- In the forked OpenSearch repository, navigate to the [OpenSearch-bot](https://github.com/apps/opensearch-bot) installation page and click "Install".
- Follow the instructions to complete the installation on the forked repository.

## Features

The app works as follows:

1. **PR Changelog Processing:** When a user opens or edits a pull request (PR) from a forked repository against an OpenSearch repository, the app scans the PR description, looking for changelog entries listed in a "Changelog" section. It then generates a changeset file from these entries and commits this file to the open PR.

2. **Automating Release Documentation:** When the PR is merged, the changeset file is stored in a designated directory in the base repository. At the time of a new release, the app scans this directory and uses the changeset files to generate comprehensive release notes and update the changelog with new entries.

This process ensures a streamlined and automated approach to maintaining up-to-date release documentation in OpenSearch repositories.

For a more detailed walkthrough of the `OpenSearch-bot` app's features, see our [Feature Details](docs/FEATURE_DETAILS.md) document.

## Usage

In order for this app to work as intended, whenever a PR is opened from an OpenSearch fork against the base repository, the PR description must include a `## Changelog` heading.

Beneath this heading is where you will add a changelog entry or entries summarizing your contribution.

In order for the app to parse your entries and generate changeset files, each entry must:

- begin with a hyphen followed by a space ("- ")
- include one of the following category prefixes, followed by a colon:
  - breaking
  - chore
  - deprecate
  - doc
  - feat
  - fix
  - infra
  - refactor
  - security
  - skip
  - test
- conclude with a description of your contribution in the imperative mood using no more than 100 characters

If the changes introduced in your PR are minor (e.g., fixing a typo), you can enter `- skip` in the "Changelog" section to instruct the app not to generate a changeset file. Please note that, if you enter `-skip` in the "Changelog" section, no other categories or descriptions can be present.

Here is an example of a properly-formatted changelog entry in a PR description:

```markdown
## Changelog

- feat: Add new feature
```

The app is equipped with robust error handling so that, if your PR description lacks the required information or needs reformatting in some way, the process will terminate and a comment will be added to your PR explaining what needs to be fixed.
